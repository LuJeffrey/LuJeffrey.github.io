## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/image/hengchen.jpeg">

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Hong Kong, specializing in political economy and information friction. In my previous work, I investigated the role of learning and information friction in economic and political crises. Building on this work, my current research has bifurcated and focuses on political economy and information friction. I have explored a variety of subjects within the realm of political economy, such as judicial decision-making and news markets. Additionally, I have developed new research on expectation formation and attention allocation in information economics.
