## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/image/hengchen.jpeg">

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Hong Kong, specializing in political economy and information friction. In my previous work, I investigated the role of learning and information friction in economic and political crises. Building on this work, my current research has bifurcated and focuses on political economy and information friction.
